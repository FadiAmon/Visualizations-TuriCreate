# Visualizations-TuriCreate

In this notebook I completed most of the tasks myself, but the lecturer demonstrated some of them.

In this notebook, I analyzed the data using TuriCreate and created advanced and interactive visualizations such as graphs, histograms, charts, 
and more using various libraries including Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly Express, and Altair.
